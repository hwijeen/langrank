I will go back to Suan soon!
The food is great and the environment is even better.
I lOVE THIS PLACE!
You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!
Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.
There was a small wait, but shorter than I expected.
Once you try it for a special occasion beware.. you can't stop!
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
When we sat, we got great and fast service.
Everything was going good until we got our meals.
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.
Seriously, this place kicks ass.
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.
Best restaurant in Brooklyn
The atmosphere is relaxed and casual.
The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.
The Cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it.
Everyone raved about the atmosphere (elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views) and the fabulous food!
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff.
Keep up the good work guys!
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.
Remind me of home.
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.
Best. Sushi. Ever.
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
Go hungry and enjoy.
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.
The sushi is amazing!!! 
I highly recommend it.
The price very reasonable.
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.
Try their chef's specials-- they are to die for.
Great Indian food
Reliable, Fresh Sushi
However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.
Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
The food options rule.
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.
I'm going back.
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant.
Loved It
Good food.
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.
my favorite place lol
The filet mignon dish was superb!
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.
I wasn't here for the pizza so I can't comment on that yet but what I had was very good.
This was a great surprise.
However, our main course was wonderful.
This restaurant was recommended by a local...as a matter of fact, he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed!
The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!
I LOVE their Thai
We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.
Service was prompt, friendly and great.
I recommend it!
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.
One of my favorite places in Brooklyn. 
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...
What more could you want?
The staff offers impeccable service.
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.
The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.
Creative, consistent, fresh.
Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.
The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.
Give it a try and enjoy.
Oh, and there's hookah.
In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.
We will go back every time we are in the City.
great food
I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers.
And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!
The appetizers are also delicious!
Fantastic!
This place is a great bargain.
I have been going back again and again.
Always a nice crowd, but never loud.
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.
A classic!
I have never had cheescake like this.
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.
Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.
The wine list is extensive and impressive.
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
It's all about the food !!
Try it!
I will be going back and heartily recommend it!
but overall i give it a 10
fresh restaurant was amazing........ food was delicious and of course fresh.
i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
We all felt it was worth it.
The fried dumplings are GREAT!
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.
I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.
And really large portions.
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.
Can't wait to go back.
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.
One of my favorite places in Manhattan.
But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.
Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC!
Highly recommended to all!
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!
Loved it!
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.
When I got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly.
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.
Great Indian Food!
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.
Service was also very good.
She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food.
This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!
also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!
Great find in the West Village!
Will comeback for sure, wish they have it here in LA..
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
I heartily recommend.
The bagel was huge.
Great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner.
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.
We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.
If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.
The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.
The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent.
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
The food is reliable and the price is moderate.
I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor.
Great atmoshere and worth every bit.
if you're daring, try the balsamic vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service.
great food, great wine list, great service in a great neighborhood...
It was well worth the wait.
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.
The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.
The service was quick and friendly.
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.
it was really good pizza.
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down
Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
The price is reasonable although the service is poor.
Faan is sooo good.
The main entree was also very good.
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.
We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd.
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.
You will find yourself returning quite often.
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good.
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city.
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm so delicious
I loved it and would go again.
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.
Good spreads, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty.
Wine list is extensive without being over-priced.
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good)  
However, it is jus too good to not praise it.
Service- friendly and attentive.
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.
The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.
Pizza here is consistently good.
Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy.
The design and atmosphere is just as good.
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.
Great staff.
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.
Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.
Planet Thai is great!
But nonetheless--great spot, great food.
never swaying, never a bad meal, never bad service...
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.
You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.
The food is good.
I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much... and we're repeat customers.
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good.
Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious setting.
This place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi.
Our food was great too!
An awesome organic dog, and a conscious eco friendly establishment.
Me and my girls will definitely go back.
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.
I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations.
I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.
Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.
For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.
A must try!
If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat.
I will definetly be going back.
The hostess was very pleasant.
However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .
I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.
(The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!)
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.
We had a very nice time.
Most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.
Also very inexpensive.
cirspy crust margherita pizza
This is the MOST wonderful restaurant in all of New York City, not just Brooklyn...
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.
I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.
I love it.
The entree was also very good.
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.
Service was good and food is wonderful.
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room.
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.
and you can't beat the prices.
And amazingly cheap.
Highly recommended!
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.
Run don't walk.
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.
The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
Loved it
It's simply the best meal in NYC.
Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise.
Everyone must come here at least once.
Inexpensive, unassuming, great time!
Decor is charming.
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.
Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev.
You can't go wrong here.
Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food.
The food was good.
I love it.
All in all, the food was great (except for the dessserts).
Great food!
Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.
the salads are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy.
The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced.
Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.
The pastas are incredible, the risottos (particularly the sepia) are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing.
the bestt!
This place is worth an one-hour drive.
If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant.
If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.
While their kitchen food is delicious, their Sushi is out of this world.
The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional.
I absolutely love this place!!!
the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily.
I really liked this place.
An unpretentious spot in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming.
Always busy but fast moving.
It was wonderful.
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
Just straight up cheap, good food.
For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
What a great place!
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .
Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York!
Yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much.
Food is excellent.
An excellent service
I'll be back for sure.
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too...
We had a good time.
The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.
Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.
My fav was the sassy lassi...
short and sweet – seating is great:it's romantic,cozy and private.
We were very pleasantly surprised.
great hot dogs..
Best Taiwanese food in NY!
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
Love YUKA.
We will be back.
But they do.
Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.
This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.
I'm not even going to bother to describe it; it speaks for itself.
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages PLEASE do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!!
It's very spicy but not offensive.
The view is spectacular, and the food is great.
The DJ is awesome, I have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and I keep going back.
I recieved prompt service with a smile.
Great vibe, lots of people.
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.
I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals.
The potato balls were not dry at all... in fact it was buttery.
It's a small cute restaurant.
quacamole at pacifico is yummy, as are the wings with chimmichuri.
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
the food is always fresh ...
Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan.
Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!
The food was good too.
Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.
I'd definitely go back again.
keep up the good work.
The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.
Great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.
Beautiful experience.
great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...
They honored reservation on Sunday afternoon very well. 
We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough. 
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
Great food.
I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.
Service is top notch.
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.
Good food: my favorite is the seafood spaghetti.
Fish is so very fresh.
Service here was great, food was fantastic.
Service was quick.
The design of the space is good.
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed.
The service was attentive, yet discreet.
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
Food is great and inexpensive.
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.
The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.
Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City!
Great survice
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent.
Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.
Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.
This place has great indian chinese food.
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).
I recommend this place to everyone.
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.
We'd go back again
Go here.
However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
Patsy's Pizza = true love
I love this place
The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
Everything about this restaurant was special.
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
The veal was incredible last night.
Located at the end of a magnificent block.
Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.
Beef noodle soup is good as well.
awesome
Nice for one time special occasion.
You can't go wrong with this place.
My husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.
When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME!!!
Wonderful at holiday time.
I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.
Unique apppetizers.
By far, the best pizza in Manhattan.
Worth the trip from Manhattan.
Love Al Di La
this place had ALL the trimmings and i mean all.
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.
And where does Patis go wrong; no where. 
The family seafood entree was very good.
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.
Seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening.
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.
Highly recommended!
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.
My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.
I can't wait to go back.
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.
I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.
The wine list is interesting and has many good values.
This is one of my favorite spot, very relaxing the food is great all the times , celebrated my engagement and my wedding here , it was very well organized .
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.
It is also extremely well priced.
The place is beautiful!
What more can you ask for?
Ambience is delightful, service impeccable.
Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)
I've been many time and have never been disappointed.
Favorite Sushi in NYC
I would highly recommend this place!
not only is the food
La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!!
My daughter's wedding reception at Water's Edge received the highest compliments from our guests.
The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.
It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.
The food was good, the place was clean and affordable.
This place blew me away...by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side.
Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.
Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.
A pleasant surprise.
sometimes i get good food and ok service.
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.
The veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.
It is terrific, as is the value.
Pacifico is a great place to casually hang out.
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
Everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome.
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
Very cozy and warm inside.....
Authentic Pakistani food.
Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.
No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
Fantastic place.
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.
The waiter was attentive, the food was delicious and the views of the city were great.
Great Hot Dogs!
I heard the lobster roll was excellent. 
Have been several times and it never dissapoints.
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.
All in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!
I pray it stays open forever.
MMmmm... it was delicious.
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.
It's a great place to order from or sit-in.
Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
Very good wine choices.
Great place, great value.
I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.
My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.
The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we've ever had!! 
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.
Excellent food for great prices
Indoor was very cozy and cute.
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.
I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.
The staff is no nonsense.
One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better.
I absolutely Loved this place.
But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.
The food is good, I can't lie.
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
The food here was mediocre at best. 
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.
I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.
"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??"
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.
The only downside... they only take cash which is OK if you know about it ahead of time.
Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.
The food was bland oily.
Would NEVER go back
Probably would not go back here.
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.
They charge different prices all the time.
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
It was totally overpriced- fish and chips was about $15.... 
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!
If you go here, do it on his off-night.
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money.
Will never be back.
Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.
"The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the ""free"" appetizer of olives was disappointing."
But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party."""
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
The food now is inconsistent.
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.
More Williamsburg Garbage
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner.
A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.
If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.
Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.
would NOT go back.
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
it is not consistent.
Overpriced and not tasty 
The counter service is bad.
I got hair in my food 2 times of then !
We were charged full price.
Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.
Would NEVER go back there.
But the pizza is way to expensive.
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.
wont come back again for sure!
The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.
Avoid this place!
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.
Dumbfoundingly Poor
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.
supercilious scorn is in.
This restaurant was way overhyped.
food was luke warm.
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.
None was made so i hung up.
At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.
At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.
The sushi was awful!
The space kind of feels like an Alice in Wonderland setting, without it trying to be that.
Priced at upper intermediate range.
The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol
Dessert is a joke...dont bother
Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.
The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.
Don't go with a larger group than 4! 
The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.
Gross food – Wow-
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.
If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.
"She replied ""well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded."" "
Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.
We left, never to return.
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.
The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.
And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?
I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.
Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.
When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
Zero ambiance to boot.
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.
I've waited over one hour for food.
The kitchen however, is almost always slow.
I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor.
I can't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York.
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.
You should pass on the calamari.
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing.
These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly.
Be sure not to get anything other than bagels!..
Chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top??
It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor.
Terrible Waste of money.. scammers
I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).
Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.
limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice. 
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!
They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand). 
Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.
But the service is HORRID!
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.
No thanks!!!
A weakness is the chicken in the salads.
WORST PLACE ON SMITH STREET IN BROOKLYN
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
We were less than impressed.
Poor service and management
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.
The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken.
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
Was surprisingly disappointed.
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.
I definitely wouldn't go back.
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.
In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.
I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!
On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.
Be prepared to wait, because the place is pretty tiny.
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila.
Not worth it.
Wretched and retching
Maggot in the food!
Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.
I will NEVER return.
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.
Just not good at all.
Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK.
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
The bar drinks were Eh, ok to say the least.
It is very overpriced and not very tasty.
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.
When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.
Polite acknowledgement is out;
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever.
I think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked.
bad staff
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.
Way below average
The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.
This place survives on reputation alone.
The only thing that strikes you is the decor?(not very pleasant).
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted.
Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.
We were offered water for the table but were not told the Voss bottles of water were $8 a piece.
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.
please don't fool us.
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.
But who says Murray's is anything about service.
Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
It just wasn't Thai.
"There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "
Fish was overdone.
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily.
This place is not worth the prices.
A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).
There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment. 
Service ok but unfriendly,filthy bathroom.
It is thick and slightly soggy.
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
Mazing interior.
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.
NO PIZZA 33 for me!
IT WAS HORRIBLE.
Had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive.
Not a great place for family or general dining.
I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it.
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
The waitress was not attentive at all.
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.
This place doesn't make any sense
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.
"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing."
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.
This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price.
Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude.
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.
Never again!
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.
Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!
She just nodded and walked off.
For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!
Not cheap but very yummy.
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary.
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
the turkey burgers are scary!
"I believe there were 2 shrimp in the ""salt encrusted shrimp"" appetizer. "
The floor was wet, the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor, no soap, and no hand towels left.
Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.
And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!
The stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.
skip dessert.
but the service was a bit slow.
We were very disappointed.
This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...
Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.
My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.
It is expensive but well worth the money.
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
So rude!!!
Eat at your own risk.
I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu.
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.
Also, I personally wasn't a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole.
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
Rude service, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one
A real dissapointment.
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service
The service is awful.
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?
I honestly don't even know where to begin.
But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
Expensive
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).
We asked for beverages and never received them.
Probably would not go again...
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
But the staff was so horrible to us.
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.
The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
Not enough wines by the glass either.
As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality.
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.
Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed.
It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.
I do not recommend.
One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it.
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma. 
I don't think I would go again.
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!
No plans to return anytime soon.
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.
Pizza was a little soggy.
Delivery guy sometimes get upset if you don't tip more than 10%.
Service is not what you are coming here for...
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!
they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.
Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.
When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost.
They're rude at times, and not very friendly.
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else.
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 
Unhygienic
The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.
Murray won't do it.
Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.
The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food.
For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... 
There is no excuse for such lousy service!
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.
Terrible would be a compliment!
I was very disappointed with this restaurant.
I would not expect this for a $55 dinner.
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.
I was speechless by the horrible food.
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
first it took us a long time to find the place.
I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have.
The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.
If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.
I was so stunned, and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing.
Delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week.
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service.
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.
The space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes - 1 hour, but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo-chinese food.
The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.
The food was actually aweful.
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
This place is incredibly tiny.
We thought the dessert would be better, Wrong!
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.
I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.
It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
